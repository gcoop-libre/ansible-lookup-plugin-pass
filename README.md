# Ansible Pass Lookup Plugin

> Ansible lookup plugin for ZXC24's [pass][0]  password manager.

This lookup plugin allows you to use a [pass][0] compatible password store to
generate passwords. It mimics de behaviour of the password lookup, but using pass
instead of plaintext files for storing the passwords.

If the password doesn't exist it will be generated.

## Usage

Clone this repository in a directory of your choice and tell ansible to look for
plugins there by setting something like this in `ansible.cfg`:

```
lookup_plugins=/path/to/ansible/plugins
```

Then just use it as you would use the password lookup, but with the path to your
password instead of the path to a file. For example, if you would normally get
your password with

```
$ pass path/to/your/password
```

you would use it like this in a playbook to set the password of a user

```yaml
vars:
  password: "{{ lookup('pass', 'path/to/your/password') }}"

tasks:
  - name: set password for user debian
    user:
      name: debian
      password: "{{ password | password_hash('sha512') }}"
      state: present
      shell: /bin/bash
```

## Settings

By default it uses `~/.password-store` as the password store. If you need to
change this set the `ANSIBLE_PASS_PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` environment variable or
the `password_store` parameter to the absolute path of the password store you
want to use.

## Parameters

You can use parameters to control how `pass generate` will be called.

* **`length`:** length of the generated password (default: `32`).
* **`symbols`:** include symbols in the generated password (default: `False`).
* **`regenerate`:** force the generation of a new password (default: `False`).
* **`password_store`:** the password store where the password is located (default: value of `ANSIBLE_PASS_PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`, if not set `~/.password-store`).

### Example

```yaml
password: "{{ lookup('pass', 'path/to/your/password length=16 symbols=True regenerate=True') }}"

```
